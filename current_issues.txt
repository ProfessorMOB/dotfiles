1. Whenver I try to change the theme, some things that are supposed to be 
transparent stop being transparent (such as the MiniFiles floating window). (Fixed!)
2. I need to change my session manager, its TRASH SLOW
3. Expand my theme options (get Dracula, Nord, etc.)
4. Turn theme manager into a plugin
